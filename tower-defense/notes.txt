Just made the project. Intending for the game to be top-down like old zelda games. Will have
day-night cycle with town-building in the day and tower-defense at night. Town-building will 
have neighbors like Animal Crossing and will require infrastructure like in Cities Skyline, but 
all infrastructure also has a purpose in defense of the town. For example, making walkways 
along the walls and from the walls to inner guard towers will not only reduce crime, but also 
allow the player to have access to higher ground if the enemies get in the gates.
Project milestones to achieve in the near future:
	1) renderer works
	2) tilemap works
	3) player movement works
	4) camera works
	5) entity-component system w/ entity factory
	6) collisions
	7) single room with four enemies
	8) attacks and more input
	9) enemy AI (adaptive to number of allies??)
	10) basic menu system

Later, implement the actual city map, building inside the city, multiple floors of the city,
the day-night cycle and the tower defense. Also NPCs with conversation and quests. Saving the 
game, handling game-overs and such can happen much later.
